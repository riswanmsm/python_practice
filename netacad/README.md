variables that are able to store exactly one given value at a time are sometimes called scalars by analogy with mathematics.

A function doesn't belong to any data - it gets data, it may create new data and it (generally) produces a result.

A method does all these things, but is also able to change the state of a selected entity.

A method is owned by the data it works for, while a function is owned by the whole code.
